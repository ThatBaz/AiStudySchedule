### PROJECT NOTES

### 1. **Project Scope & Requirements**

- **Objective**: Build a web app that helps users schedule study/work sessions and generate flashcards from study materials.
- **Core Features**:
    - **Study Schedule Management**: A planner that generates and adjusts a study schedule based on user input.
    - **Material Summarization and Flashcard Generation**: AI-powered summarization of study materials (e.g., PDFs, slides) into flashcards.
    - **Personalization**: Adjust flashcard topics and schedule based on user preferences.

### 2. **High-Level Architecture**

- **Frontend**: Web interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (consider React or Vue for interactivity).
- **Backend**: Server-side logic for scheduling, flashcard generation, and user management.
- **Database**: Store user profiles, schedules, study materials, and generated flashcards.
- **AI Components**:
    - Text summarization for study material processing.
    - Scheduling algorithms for personalized study plans.

### 3. **Detailed Steps**

### Step 1: Set Up the Environment

- **Tech Stack**: Consider using Python (for AI models) with Flask or Django for the backend, and PostgreSQL or Firebase for the database.
- **Hosting**: Use a platform like Heroku for deployment, which supports Python and quick database integration.

### Step 2: Build User Authentication

- **User Accounts**: Set up sign-in/sign-up options (you can use Firebase Authentication for simplicity).
- **User Profiles**: Store user preferences (e.g., study hours, work schedule, preferred flashcard topics) in the database.

### Step 3: Scheduling Algorithm

- **Data Collection**: Take user input on available study/work hours and deadlines.
- **Algorithm**:
    - Start simple, like a **time-blocking algorithm**. Allocate time based on deadlines, study session duration, and user availability.
    - **Optional**: Implement priority weighting (if certain subjects or tasks are more critical).
- **Resources**:
    - Python libraries like `numpy` for calculations.
    - Consider using `pandas` for schedule data manipulation and tracking.

### Step 4: AI-Powered Summarization and Flashcard Generation

- **Text Summarization**:
    - Use a pre-trained language model like **Hugging Face’s BART or T5** for text summarization. They’re relatively easy to use and well-suited for generating concise summaries from PDFs and slides.
- **Flashcard Generation**:
    - Convert summaries into question-answer pairs. Use the same model to identify key points for potential questions and answers.
- **Resources**:
    - Hugging Face transformers library (`pip install transformers`) to load models.
    - Datasets for testing: **SQuAD** (Stanford Question Answering Dataset) or **DuReader** (for question generation in flashcard format).

### Step 5: Develop the Frontend

- **UI for Scheduling**: Use a calendar view for easy interaction, allowing users to view and edit their schedules.
- **Flashcard Interface**: Present flashcards in a flip format with a question on one side and the answer on the other.
- **JavaScript Libraries**: For UI/UX, try **FullCalendar.js** (scheduling) and **Flip.js** (flashcard interactions).

### Step 6: Integrate Flashcard & Summarization Features

- **Input Options**: Allow users to upload files (PDF, slides) for summarization.
- **Text Extraction**:
    - For PDFs: Use Python’s `PyMuPDF` or `pdfplumber`.
    - For slides (PPTX): Use `python-pptx` to read content.
- **Summarization & Flashcard Generation Pipeline**:
    - Extract content from the uploaded file, run it through the summarization model, and convert the output into flashcards.
- **Store Flashcards**: Save generated flashcards in the database linked to the user’s profile.

### Step 7: Connect Scheduling and Flashcards

- Ensure the study schedule suggests appropriate flashcards based on topics and user preferences.
- Optional: Add notifications or reminders when it’s time to review certain flashcards.

### Step 8: Test & Optimize

- **Testing**: Ensure all features work smoothly, especially AI summarization accuracy and schedule generation.
- **Optimization**:
    - Monitor the performance of the summarization model to handle large documents.
    - Test scheduling efficiency, especially for users with complex schedules.

### Step 9: Deploy the Web App

- Use Heroku or DigitalOcean to host the application. Set up CI/CD for smooth updates.
- Ensure security and scalability, especially for handling file uploads and sensitive data.

### 4. **Optional Features**

- **Progress Tracking**: Track the user’s study progress over time and adjust schedules dynamically.
- **Session Analytics**: Offer insights on study time and areas for improvement.

### 5. **Datasets and Resources**

- **Text Summarization**: Use datasets like CNN/DailyMail dataset for summarization.
- **Flashcard Creation**: SQuAD dataset can help train models for Q&A-style flashcards.
- **APIs and Libraries**:
    - **Hugging Face Transformers** for NLP models.
    - **Flask/Django** for backend.
    - **FullCalendar.js** for frontend scheduling interface.
